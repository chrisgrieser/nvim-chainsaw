Speed up log creation. Create various kinds of language-specific log statements,
such as logs of variables, assertions, or stacktraces, timings, and more.

## Installation
**Requirements**
- nvim 0.10 or higher.
- Optional for [smart variable identification](#smart-variable-identification):
  Treesitter parser for the respective languages.

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{ "chrisgrieser/nvim-chainsaw" },

-- packer
use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-chainsaw" }
```

## Built-in language support
- JavaScript (and supersets)
- Python
- Lua (with special considerations for `nvim_lua`)
- Shell (and supersets)
- AppleScript
- Ruby
- Rust
- CSS (and supersets)
- Go

Not every language supports every type of log statement. For details on what is
supported, see [log-statements-data.lua](./lua/chainsaw/log-statements-data.lua).
For languages like go, packages fmt and time are to be imported manually by the plugin user.

> [!NOTE]
> For non-scripting languages like CSS, `nvim-chainsaw` uses statements such as
> `outline: 2px solid red !important;` that are the closest thing to logging
> you have.

## Usage
The plugin offers various types of log statements. Bind keymaps for the ones you
want to use.

All operations are dot-repeatable.

### List of commands

```lua
-- log the name & value of the variable under the cursor
require("chainsaw").variableLog()

-- like variableLog, but with syntax specific to inspect an object such as
-- `console.log(JSON.stringify(foobar))` in javascript
require("chainsaw").objectLog()

-- inspect the type of the variable under cursor, such as `typeof foo` in js
require("chainsaw").typeLog()

-- assertion statement for variable under cursor
require("chainsaw").assertLog()

-- Minimal log statement, with an emoji for differentiation. Intended for
-- control flow inspection, that is to quickly glance whether a condition was
-- triggered or not.
require("chainsaw").emojiLog()

-- Sound-playing statement for audible debugging.
-- Depending on the type of log statement, it is either a terminal bell
-- (requiring the terminal) or a system sound.
-- Inspired by https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41519046
require("chainsaw").sound()

-- create log statement, and position the cursor to enter a message
require("chainsaw").messageLog()

-- 1st call: start measuring the time
-- 2nd call: logs the time duration since
require("chainsaw").timeLog()

-- debug statements like `debugger` in javascript or `breakpoint()` in python
require("chainsaw").debugLog()

-- prints the stacktrace of the current call
require("chainsaw").stacktraceLog()

-- clearing statement, such as `console.clear()`
require("chainsaw").clearLog()

---------------------------------------------------

-- remove all log statements created by nvim-chainsaw
require("chainsaw").removeLogs()
```

These features can also be accessed with the user command `:Chainsaw`. Each
option corresponds to the commands above. For example, `:Chainsaw
variableLog` is same as `:lua require("chainsaw").variableLog()`.

When using lua functions, `variableLog`, `objectLog`, `typeLog`, and `assertLog`
can also be used in **visual mode** to use the visual selection instead of the
word under the cursor.

> [!TIP]
> `variableLog` for `nvim_lua` uses a log statement that inspects objects and is
> designed to work with various notification plugins like `nvim-notify`,
> `snacks.nvim`, or `noice.nvim`. If using `snacks.nvim`, lua syntax
> highlighting is added.

### Smart variable identification
When the variable under the cursor is an object with fields, `chainsaw` attempts
to automatically select the correct field. Note that this feature requires the
Treesitter parser of the respective language.

```lua
myVariable.myF[i]eld = "foobar"
-- prints: myVariable.myField

myVa[r]iable.myField = "foobar"
-- prints: myVariable
```

Filetypes currently supporting this feature:
- Lua
- Python
- JavaScript (and supersets)

PRs adding support for more languages are welcome.

## Configuration

### Basic configuration

```lua
-- default settings
require("chainsaw").setup {
	-- The marker should be a unique string, since lines with it are highlighted
	-- and since `removeLogs` will remove any line with it. Thus, emojis or
	-- strings like "[Chainsaw]" are recommended.
	marker = "ü™ö",

	-- Highlight lines with the marker.
	-- When using `lazy.nvim`, you need to add `event = VeryLazy` to the plugin
	-- spec to have existing log statements highlighted as well.
	---@type string|false
	logHighlightGroup = "Visual",

	-- emojis used for `emojiLog`
	logEmojis = { "üîµ", "üü©", "‚≠ê", "‚≠ï", "üíú", "üî≤" },
}
```

### Custom log statements
Custom log statements can be added in the `setup()` call. There are various
placeholders that are dynamically replaced:
- `{{marker}}` inserts the value from `config.marker`. Each log statement should
  have one, so that the line can be removed via `.removeLogs()`.
- `{{var}}` inserts the variable as described further above.
- `.emojiLog()` only: `{{emoji}}` inserts the emoji.
- `.timeLog()` only: `{{index}}` inserts a running index starting from 1.

See [log-statements-data.lua](./lua/chainsaw/log-statements-data.lua) for
the built-in log statements. PRs adding log statements for more languages are
welcome.

```lua
require("chainsaw").setup ({
	logStatements = {
		variableLog = {
			javascript = 'console.log("{{marker}} {{var}}:", {{var}});',
			otherFiletype = ‚Ä¶ -- <-- add the statement for your filetype here
		},
		-- the same way for the other log statement operations
	},
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> 1. The strings may not include line breaks. If you want to use multi-line log
>    statements, use a list of strings instead, each string representing one
>    line.
> 2. See [superset-inheritance.lua](./lua/chainsaw/superset-inheritance.lua)
>    for how language supersets (such as `typescript` inheriting from
>    `javascript`) is handled.

### Have your formatter ignore the log statements
A common problem is that formatters like `prettier` split up the log statements
into multiple lines, making them hard to read and breaking `removeLogs()`, which
relies on each line containing the marker emoji.

The simplest method to deal with this is to customize the log statement in
your configuration to include an ignore-comment: `/* prettier-ignore */`.

```lua
require("chainsaw").setup {
	logStatements = {
		variableLog = {
			javascript = {
				"/* prettier-ignore */ // {{marker}}", -- adding this
				'console.log("{{marker}} {{var}}:", {{var}});',
			},
		},
	},
}
```

> [!TIP]
> The log statement now needs to be a list of strings as line breaks are not
> supported, and the ignore-comment should include the marker for removal via
> `.removeLogs`.

- [logsitter](https://github.com/gaelph/logsitter.nvim)

The other plugins are more feature-rich, while `nvim-chainsaw` tries to
achieve the core functionality in a far more lightweight manner to keep
maintenance minimal.
